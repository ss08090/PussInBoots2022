Eat those flowers.

1073
00:49:19,542 --> 00:49:21,820
I-I'm not a magic locust.

1074
00:49:21,855 --> 00:49:24,133
Why, I'm not a locust at all.

1075
00:49:24,168 --> 00:49:26,308
What are you, then?
Some sort of demon grasshopper?

1076
00:49:26,342 --> 00:49:28,034
-A deadly fairy?
-[screaming]

1077
00:49:28,068 --> 00:49:29,656
Put a spell on the forest, then.

1078
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:31,313
I-I don't cast spells.

1079
00:49:31,347 --> 00:49:34,109
-Well, what do you do?
-Well, I-I-I judge you.

1080
00:49:34,143 --> 00:49:37,457
I sit on your shoulder
and judge your actions

1081
00:49:37,491 --> 00:49:39,459
and the quality
of your character.

1082
00:49:39,493 --> 00:49:41,047
I'm your conscience.

1083
00:49:41,081 --> 00:49:42,703
I really did overpack.

1084
00:49:42,738 --> 00:49:44,291
-[screams]
-JACK HORNER: Whoa!

1085
00:49:44,326 --> 00:49:46,190
Help me, Jack! Help!

1086
00:49:46,224 --> 00:49:48,054
Aren't you gonna help him, Jack?

1087
00:49:48,088 --> 00:49:49,710
You're losing a lot of men.

1088
00:49:49,745 --> 00:49:51,747
I'm not really stressing
about the manpower.

1089
00:49:51,781 --> 00:49:55,302
I've got a bottomless bag
of magic weapons.

1090
00:49:55,337 --> 00:49:57,132
These babies are gonna
get me that wish

1091
00:49:57,166 --> 00:50:00,169
even after the whole team
is dead and gone.

1092
00:50:00,204 --> 00:50:02,309
Now, now, Jack,
as your conscience, I...

1093
00:50:02,344 --> 00:50:04,001
-[squawks]
-Oh, my word!

1094
00:50:04,035 --> 00:50:05,830
It's the noble phoenix.

1095
00:50:05,864 --> 00:50:08,384
She's the symbol of rebirth
and the eternal...

1096
00:50:08,419 --> 00:50:09,937
-[flame whooshing]
-Oh!

1097
00:50:09,972 --> 00:50:11,215
[laughing]

1098
00:50:11,249 --> 00:50:14,149
Pretty boss flamethrower, right?

1099
00:50:14,183 --> 00:50:17,600
I really have my work
cut out for me on this one.

1100
00:50:17,635 --> 00:50:21,466
JACK HORNER: Don't be near
where I'm flame-throwing.

1101
00:50:26,954 --> 00:50:28,335
[Puss chuckles]

1102
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:30,924
PUSS:
Do your job, demon flowers.

1103
00:50:30,958 --> 00:50:32,477
Soon.

1104
00:50:35,377 --> 00:50:36,861
[groans]

1105
00:50:36,895 --> 00:50:38,552
Okay, Kitty,
I think I've got it now.

1106
00:50:38,587 --> 00:50:40,554
[straining]

1107
00:50:40,589 --> 00:50:42,936
-Trust me! [whimpers]
-KITTY: Easy, easy.

1108
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:44,903
You're gonna give yourself
a hernia.

1109
00:50:44,938 --> 00:50:47,044
Here, one more time. Like this.

1110
00:50:47,078 --> 00:50:49,736
[echoing]:
Trust me.

1111
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:52,083
Aw. But of course
I trust you and Puss,

1112
00:50:52,118 --> 00:50:53,636
even without the eyes.

1113
00:50:53,671 --> 00:50:55,949
Yeah? Big mistake.

1114
00:50:55,983 --> 00:50:57,571
What do you mean?
You're my friends.

1115
00:50:57,606 --> 00:50:59,539
You know what trust gets you?

1116
00:50:59,573 --> 00:51:02,645
A sock, a rock
and a swim in the river.

1117
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:04,302
You have to trust
somebody, right?

1118
00:51:04,337 --> 00:51:05,924
Not me. Uh-uh.

1119
00:51:05,959 --> 00:51:07,719
Whenever I've let my guard down,

1120
00:51:07,754 --> 00:51:10,998
I've been double-crossed,
declawed, played and betrayed.

1121
00:51:12,276 --> 00:51:13,898
Never again.

1122
00:51:13,932 --> 00:51:15,486
I am a solo act.

1123
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:19,006
I keep my secrets,
and I play my cards close.

1124
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:21,423
That's how you get
a winning hand.

1125
00:51:21,457 --> 00:51:22,907
Take it from me.

1126
00:51:22,941 --> 00:51:24,357
Never trust anyone.

1127
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:29,776
W-Wait.

1128
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:32,296
That's amazing. [gasps]

1129
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:33,814
You're good.

1130
00:51:33,849 --> 00:51:36,334
[clears throat]
Kitty, I've been thinking.

1131
00:51:36,369 --> 00:51:38,336
Ugh, thinking about what?

1132
00:51:38,371 --> 00:51:40,269
My beautiful beard.

1133
00:51:40,304 --> 00:51:42,271
It is very distinguished, yes,

1134
00:51:42,306 --> 00:51:47,690
but it does deprive the world
a good look at, uh, the face.

1135
00:51:47,725 --> 00:51:52,626
So, if it will make you happy,
I could be convinced to...

1136
00:51:52,661 --> 00:51:54,111
-I've gotten used to it.
-Wait, what?

1137
00:51:54,145 --> 00:51:55,871
The beard-- keep it.

1138
00:51:55,905 --> 00:51:59,495
Uh, well, you see, uh...
[chuckles, sobs]

1139
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:01,946
Kitty, please,
get this itchy thing off of me!

1140
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:04,155
It's like a fever on my face!

1141
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:08,470
Hold on. Is the great
Puss in Boots asking for help?

1142
00:52:08,504 --> 00:52:10,299
[speaks in Spanish]
Help. You were right.

1143
00:52:10,334 --> 00:52:12,957
-The beard is disgusting.
-And?

1144
00:52:12,991 --> 00:52:16,029
And it's like a possum
crawled on my face.

1145
00:52:16,063 --> 00:52:17,168
And?

1146
00:52:17,203 --> 00:52:19,791
And died of shame.

1147
00:52:19,826 --> 00:52:21,345
Okay, okay, possum face.

1148
00:52:23,485 --> 00:52:25,556
-I won't make you beg.
-[grunts]

1149

Ow! [grunts]

1150
00:52:29,042 --> 00:52:30,216
Hey, slow down. Oh!

1151
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:31,493
Go with the grain.

1152
00:52:31,527 --> 00:52:33,460
You got to go with the grain.

1153
00:52:33,495 --> 00:52:35,186
-I know what I'm doing.
-Hey!

1154
00:52:35,221 --> 00:52:38,362
I'm a master of the blade.
Right... [speaks in Spanish]

1155
00:52:38,396 --> 00:52:40,536
-[laughing]
-What? What? What's funny?

1156
00:52:40,571 --> 00:52:42,331
-Nothing should be funny.
-KITTY: Shh. [speaks in Spanish]

1157
00:52:51,029 --> 00:52:53,929
Ah, there's that handsome face
I remember.

1158
00:52:53,963 --> 00:52:56,345
The face I haven't seen since...

1159
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:58,520
-Hey!
-...Santa Coloma.

1160
00:52:58,554 --> 00:53:02,075
Ah, yes. Santa Coloma.

1161
00:53:02,109 --> 00:53:03,766
You had it coming.

1162
00:53:05,043 --> 00:53:08,288
Here. You can have my...
[speaks in Spanish] blade.

1163
00:53:09,531 --> 00:53:10,911
Thank you.

1164
00:53:10,946 --> 00:53:12,223
Better than a stick.

[singsongy]:
I think you like him.

1172
00:53:28,274 --> 00:53:29,758
No. No, I don't.

1173
00:53:29,792 --> 00:53:31,587
[singsongy]: I think
you're ready to name him.

1174
00:53:31,622 --> 00:53:34,418
No, I just need his easy path
to get my wish.

1175
00:53:34,452 --> 00:53:35,902
You mean my wish.

1176
00:53:35,936 --> 00:53:37,973

You mean my wish!

1177
00:53:39,008 --> 00:53:40,562
Sorry.

Oh, I don't know.
I might keep him.

1182
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:54,714
Would you like a treat?

1183
00:53:54,748 --> 00:53:56,716
Nice granny bag, Little Jack.

1184
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:58,407
It's not a granny bag.

1185
00:53:58,442 --> 00:54:00,754
It is a magic nanny bag.

1186
00:54:00,789 --> 00:54:02,756
Now, make with the map,

1187
